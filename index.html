                <p> I’m an Agile, Entrepreneurial, Christian, Electrical and Communications Engineer with over 15 years Innovation & IT strategy execution in global organizations in the for-profit and not-for-profit sectors. </p>

                <p>Driven by a deep understanding of business needs, I mobilize teams in the delivery of technology solutions that are aligned with business goals.</p>

                <p>As an Electrical Engineering graduate, I started off my career in Technical Operations at a start-up Internet Service Provider. I did everything from mail server setup, Cisco router configuration to System Administration on both Unix and Windows. I've held various IT leadership roles. </p>
                <p>I'm excited to pivot to a career in full-stack development so I can spend more time doing what I love – being creative and using technology to solve business problems.</p>
